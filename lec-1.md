### 4. Why Data Science?
- The world produces **Zettabytes of data**.  
- Example internet traffic distribution:  
  - Video: 53%  
  - Social: 12%  
  - Gaming: 10%  
  - Browsing: 6%  
  - Others: Messaging, Marketplace, Cloud, etc.  

ðŸ‘‰ Data science helps make sense of this *massive library of information*.

### 5. Classic Case Study â€” **Cholera Outbreak**
- In the 1800s, cholera deaths were thought to be due to **bad air (miasma)**.  
- **John Snow** suspected waterborne cause.  
- He **collected data** â†’ mapped deaths â†’ found link to **Broadway water pump**.  
- Closing the pump stopped deaths.  

ðŸ”‘ **First real Data Science project**:  
Collect â†’ Analyze â†’ Conclude â†’ Act.

### 6. Data Science Process
1. **Understand the Problem** â€“ What are we solving?  
2. **Collect Data** â€“ Surveys, sensors, scraping, etc.  
3. **Prepare Data** â€“ Clean, remove outliers, handle missing values.  
4. **Plan, Train & Validate Model** â€“ Choose learning model, tune, test.  
5. **Data Insight** â€“ Predictions + meaningful conclusions.  

ðŸ’¡ *Analogy*: Like cooking â€” decide dish â†’ gather ingredients â†’ prep â†’ cook â†’ serve.

### 7. Tools & Skills Youâ€™ll Learn
- **Programming:** Python basics.  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas (cleaning, merging, grouping).  
- **Visualization:** Charts, scatter plots, histograms.  
- **Math & Stats:** Probability, hypothesis testing, covariance.  
- **Machine Learning:**  
  - Supervised: Regression, Classification.  
  - Unsupervised: Clustering, PCA, kNN.  
- **Neural Networks:** Layers & activation functions.

### 8. Types of Data & Attributes
- Dataset = collection of **entities (rows)** with **attributes (columns)**.  
- **Nominal:** Categories w/o order (e.g., Male/Female).  
- **Ordinal:** Ordered categories (e.g., Rank: 1st, 2nd, 3rd).  
- **Discrete:** Countable numbers (0, 1, 2, 10).  
- **Continuous:** Real values (2.5, Ï€, 1.34).  

ðŸ’¡ *Analogy:*  
- Nominal = Shirt colors  
- Ordinal = Shirt sizes (S < M < L)  
- Discrete = Number of shirts  
- Continuous = Weight of shirt in grams
